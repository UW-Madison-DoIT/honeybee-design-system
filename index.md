### Our Mission

This system was created to provide developers across the UW-Madison campus with an easy-to-use, accessible, curated collection of UI elements and development guidelines that are supported by User Experience expertise and user research. Our mission is to give UW-Madison's presence across the web a superior, quickly recognizable sense of place -- a "digital campus."
