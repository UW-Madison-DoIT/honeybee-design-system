Navigation allows users to move across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within the app.

We focus on three elements of navigation: **dropdown menu, navigation drawer,** and **top app bar** (sometimes called “toolbar).

There are two commonly-used navigation icons in UW apps:

+ A menu icon (three horizontal lines), which opens side navigation
+ A back arrow, which returns to the previous screen

### Dropdown Menu

#### Overview

A menu displays a list of choices on a temporary surface. They appear when users interact with a button, action, or other control.

#### Usage

A menu allows the user to choose one value from a list. When a drop-down list is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one.

#### How it works (interaction)

Menus appear in front of all other permanent UI elements.

Menus should be positioned relative to the edge of the screen or browser. They typically appear next to (or in front of) the element that generates them.

#### Anatomy

Menus display lists of related and unrelated options. Menus appear when a user taps an interactive UI element such as an icon, button, or text.

#### Why we chose this

We chose to use menus on our websites and apps, because they are:

+ Nimble: Easy to open, close and interact with
+ Contextual: Content suited to user needs
+ Scannable: Easy to quickly glance at or read

### Navigation drawer

A navigation drawer allows users to simultaneously access drawer destinations and app content. On desktop the side navigation is on the same plane with app content and affect the screen’s layout grid. On mobile, side navigation becomes a modal with a scrim to block interaction with the rest of an app’s content and doesn’t affect the layout grid.

Side navigation can be permanently visible or opened and closed by tapping a navigation menu icon (three horizontal bars).

#### Usage

Navigation drawers provide access to destinations and app functionality, such as switching accounts. They can either be permanently on-screen or controlled by a navigation menu icon (three horizontal lines).

#### Anatomy

To aid scanning of navigation elements, use recognizable icons for actions when conventions exist.

Horizontal dividers should be used to separate groups of navigation destinations within the list. They extend across the full width of the drawer.

### Top app bar

The top app bar displays information and actions relating to the current screen of the app. It is sometimes called a header or toolbar.

#### Usage

The top app bar provides actions related to the current screen. It’s used for branding, screen titles, navigation, and actions.

#### How it works (interaction)

Top app bars persist across screens but optionally can disappear when the user scrolls.

When a screen is resized, the top app bar resizes with it. Actions are consolidated either into the menu icon or the overflow menu (three vertical dots).

#### Anatomy

Placement of elements in a top app bar:

+ Place the **navigation icon** on the far left
+ Place the **title** of the app to the right of the menu icon
+ Place **actions** on the right side of the top bar, either as icons or in an overflow menu (three vertical dots).
+ Place an optional **overflow menu** (three vertical dots) to the far right

Order actions by putting the most-used action on the far left, second most used action to its right, and so on. Any remaining or secondary actions should be placed in an overflow menu (three vertical dots).
