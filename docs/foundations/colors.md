Color use is one of the most effective ways to make an immediate connection to 
the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. The primary and secondary colors are based 
on <a href="https://brand.wisc.edu/web/colors/" target="_blank">University brand
colors</a>. These colors, combined with a clear visual hierarchy, ample white 
space, a contextual HTML structure, and good information design will provide 
users with a clear and consistent experience.

### General guidelines

The palette is designed to support a range of distinct visual styles and augment
the communication of various actions. It is important colors are used 
consistently, so they retain meaning and the user experience is consistent 
across campus apps.

#### Color accessibility

- Use color alongside specific status and action labels or icons. 
- Avoid using color exclusively to communicate statuses and actions.
- Our colors meet contrast accessibility (WCAG 2.1 level AA). 
	- Contrast accessibility is the relationship between foreground color, 
	background color, and text/icon size. 
	- Our colors meet WCAG 2.1 level AA contrast accessibility with a ratio of 
	at least 4.5:1 for 14pt - 16pt (1.2em) fonts/icons, and at least 3:1 for 
	18pt (1.5em) fonts/icons. 


### Primary

The primary colors should be used in all applications.

{% include colors.html category="Primary" %}

### Secondary

The secondary color palette is designed to provide creative flexibility. These 
colors are complementary to the primary colors. They should be used sparingly 
and never draw the eye to more than one piece of information at a time.

- **Green** conveys a successful outcome or a pathway to success in completing a
  transaction. (For example, a submit button may be green)
- **Yellow** may be used to highlight an element on a page or show focus.
- **Blue** is typically used as a link color or button color for buttons that 
  begin transactions.
- **Red** is often used for error message icons or in a small amount of text. Be
  aware that too much red is distracting and alarming for users, impairing 
  focus on a page.

### Background

These colors are used largely for background blocks and large content areas. 
When alternating between tones, be sure to monitor contrast between adjacent 
colors. (Use the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" 
target="_blank">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a> tool to check accessibility.)

### Foreground

These colors are used largely for foreground text or defining features on an 
icon.

{% include colors.html category="Foreground" %}

### Color combinations

Avoid placing icons and components on background colors that violate WCAG 
contrast accessibility.  

For example, avoid placing a Primary Blue #0479A8 button on a Primary Red 
\#C5050C background. Use the 
<a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" 
target="_blank">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a> tool to check the accessibility of 
your design decisions.

### Usage

Each component will have a specific color use. Refer to specific components 
regarding usage.
