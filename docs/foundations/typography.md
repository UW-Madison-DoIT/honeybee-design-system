We use the style and appearance of our accessible text to ensure it's legible,
readable, accessible and visually appealing.

### Typefaces

The IT Design System uses the [Roboto][] typeface.

The type was chosen
because it is flexible, accessible and free to use, which is necessary to
accommodate projects across UWâ€™s campus.

- Primary Font: Roboto
- Fallback Fonts: Helvetica, Arial
- Title Font: Verlag

### General Guidelines

- Never end a header or label with a period (.)
- Only use a period (.) for sentences, paragraphs, and copy.
- Avoid use of all caps wherever possible.
